# vmscripts

I've made this repository to host a couple scripts to speed up the installation process of virtual machines on virtualbox. Scripts inside this repository will be able to change the osboxes.org hostname and users, and also update and install packages I want. I'm figuring out how to program bash along the way, but the hope is to be able to be alb eto work towards making one script I download and run on the vm that sets up everything as I want. I'm running these on Debian based linux operating systems.
